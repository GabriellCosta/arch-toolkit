# Arch Toolkit

### Hello World!!
Everybody have those useful files, they are copied and improved on every project, right?

Like utils, adapters, or even some architecture stuff.

What do I have here? Well... I'm trying to extract this things on small libraries. \o/

This is the toolkit that I had used and improved across the projects I worked with. Actually, not all of them, I'm bringing one by one.

###### For now:

- **[Statemachine](toolkit/statemachine)** - A simple way to handle view change states
- **[Recycler-Adapter](toolkit/recycler-adapter)** - A Recycler Adapter implementation using Custom Views and a "bind" interface

###### In progress:

- **LiveData** - Some custom implementations of LiveData and some extensions

###### Backlog:

- **Delegates** - Some delegates to simplify Activity/Fragment/Views boilerplate code
- **Extensions** - Some extensions to speed up your code
- **Add Tests and code coverage.** (Sorry about that) =(

I'm trying to publish everything on JCenter, but I'll only publish projects with javadoc and implemented samples. So if you want use something not published, feel free to copy and paste into your project.

Take a look in the REAME files inside the project modules and give it a try. =P
You'll find instructions to add them into your project and how to use them.

###### Have improvements?
Open a pull request! It will make me really really happy!

###### Need some custom behavior or something else?
Open a issue or copy the classes into your project, I think the code is small and simple, your can do whatever you want with them.

But try to tell me what you miss and then I can improve!! =D
